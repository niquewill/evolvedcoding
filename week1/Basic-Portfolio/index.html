			<p>1, 2, 3, and it's on!  Monique Hawkins is the name and the name of the game is Web Developing.  Maybe it’s this amazing Cubs game or the potential for them to win the Pennant after over 100 years or just the excitement of learning something new.  In case you haven't noticed I'm not your typical Southern Belle.  Born and raised in the South and a lover of all things simple and pure.  Simple as in things aren't that difficult to appreciate.  My life is a gift and every day I'm noticing a new present. From the outside, you would assume my life has been "average".  I've triumphed over many adversities. Not to sound too poetic but, "Still I Rise" or my bond to Greek Mythology, "rise from the ashes, like a Phoenix I have. The first in my family to graduate from college.  Earning a B.S. in Marketing, excelling in retail management, only to leave and see a greater adventure ahead. I've had the wonderful honor of touching lives; teaching for 12 years. Now focusing on my own journey, passion, and purpose.  Web Development has surpassed my amazement of the potential that I know it will evolve to. Like many coders hoping to let me tell my own stories and leave my mark on the world....&#9997;.
